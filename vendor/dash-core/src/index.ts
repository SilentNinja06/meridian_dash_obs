/**
 * dash_core_obs — the shared, lore-free machinery behind the MERIDIAN and
 * friendly Obsidian dashboards. This is a build-time library: consumers bundle
 * it into their own `main.js` via esbuild (it externalizes `obsidian` the same
 * as they do), so there is no runtime dependency and no install-order problem.
 *
 * Everything here is host-plugin-agnostic: it may use genuine Obsidian host
 * APIs (`App`, `TFile`, `requestUrl`, `moment`, …) that exist identically in
 * every Obsidian runtime, but it names no dashboard's lore — no MERIDIAN, no
 * Proverbs, no companion-plugin ids, no canon lines. Host-specific copy, seed
 * content, palettes, and the directives header are all injected by the host.
